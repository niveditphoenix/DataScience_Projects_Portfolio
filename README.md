# DataScience_Projects_Portfolio
Portfolio Space holding my work on Data-Science projects. 

This repository holds various Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning based projects worked by me on personal and professional grounds. I just love this curiosity developing in me to drive my energy in learning this field and trying to address a real-time situation.

Python as the language has been used and submission is with Jupyter notebooks towards these projects.
