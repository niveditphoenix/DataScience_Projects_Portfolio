# DataScience_Projects_Portfolio
Portfolio Space holding my work on Data-Science projects. 

This repository holds various Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning based projects worked by me on personal and professional grounds. I just love this curiosity developing in me to drive my energy in learning this field and trying to address a real-time situation.

Python as the language has been used and submission is with Jupyter notebooks towards these projects.

- ### Deep Learning

	- [MNIST Digit Recognition Using CNNs](https://github.com/niveditphoenix/DataScience_Projects_Portfolio/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Projects%20Using%20Tensorflow%20%26%20KERAS/MNIST_Digit_Recognition_CNN_DL.ipynb): Building a complete CNN Model using Keras on MNIST Dataset holding images with 28x28 = 784 as pixel size of hand-written digits ranging from 0 to 9, net of 10 numbers as 10 classes. Evaluated and classified each image from TEST data-set into these 10 classes using this model.
	- [Sentiment Analysis as Text Classification (NLP) on Reviews for DaVinci Book](https://github.com/niveditphoenix/DataScience_Projects_Portfolio/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Projects%20Using%20Tensorflow%20%26%20KERAS/Sentiment_Analysis_NLP_DaVinci_TensorflowTokenizer_DNN.ipynb): NLP base text-classification project build using Tensorflow Tokenizer and Keras's API for Deep-Neural-Network through Fully-Connected Dense Layers. Model that is build on train data sets with labelled data is then used to identify Sentiments on test data to be classified either as Positive (1) or Negative (0).
